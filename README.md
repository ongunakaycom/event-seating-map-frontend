## 🏗️ Architecture Choices

### Technology Stack

| Category | Technology | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Frontend | React 18 | Component-based UI architecture |
| Language | TypeScript | Type safety & better developer experience |
| Build Tool | Vite | Fast development & optimized builds |
| State Management | Zustand | Lightweight store with localStorage persistence |
| UI Framework | Bootstrap 5 | Responsive grid system & utility classes |
| Icons | Bootstrap Icons | Modern icon set for seat visualization |
| Styling | CSS Modules | Component-scoped styling |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **State Management (Zustand)**
   - Simple API with minimal boilerplate
   - Built-in persistence middleware for localStorage
   - Centralized seat selection logic with TypeScript support

2. **Component Structure**
   ```
   src/
   ├── components/
   │   ├── SeatMap/     # Renders venue sections & seats with responsive grid
   │   └── Summary/     # Displays selected seats & pricing
   ├── store/           # Zustand state management
   ├── types/           # TypeScript type definitions
   └── App.tsx          # Main application layout
   ```

3. **Responsive Strategy**
   - Mobile-first approach with breakpoint constants
   - Dynamic icon sizing based on viewport width
   - Flexbox grid system for 2-column layout on desktop
   - Offcanvas navigation for mobile devices

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - `useMemo`/`useCallback` for expensive calculations
   - React.memo for preventing unnecessary re-renders
   - Responsive scaling without layout shifts
   - Optimized for 15,000+ seats

## 🔧 Configuration

### Price Tiers
Modify `PRICE_TIERS` in `src/types/venue.ts`:

```typescript
export const PRICE_TIERS: PriceTier[] = [
  { id: 1, price: 50, color: '#4caf50', label: 'Standard' },
  { id: 2, price: 60, color: '#2196f3', label: 'Premium' },
  { id: 3, price: 75, color: '#9c27b0', label: 'VIP' },
];
```

### Maximum Seats
Change `maxSeats` in `src/store/useSeatStore.ts`:

```typescript
maxSeats: 8, // Modify this value
```

### Breakpoints
Adjust responsive breakpoints in `src/components/SeatMap/SeatMap.tsx`:

```typescript
const BREAKPOINTS = {
  MOBILE: 768,
  TABLET: 992
} as const;
```
